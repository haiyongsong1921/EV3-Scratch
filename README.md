# Tech-Scratch
This repo contains the scratch code, and the README file describes the details information of each project that seperated by project name.

There're 2 folders in this repo, one is of LEGO EV3 scratch code, and the other is of DJI RoboMaster S1 scratch code.


> The suffix of LEGO EV3 Scratch project is 'lmsp'
## 1. EV3/Drive Up a Slope
> The ev3 robot will run up a slop, and it will stop running automatically when it reaches to the top. It uses gyro sensor to ajust it is on a slop or flat.  [头条教学视频](https://www.ixigua.com/i6796605892138631683/)

## 2. EV3/Ultrasonic_sensor
> The ev3 will run forward by default, and it will use ultrasonic sensor to detect the block in front of it, then it will backward and turn left when the front block is near less than 20cm. [头条教学视频](https://www.ixigua.com/i6796925397511438851/)

## 3. EV3/infrared_remote_control
> You can control the ev3 robot moving by pressing the buttons on the beacon of infrared sensor.  [头条教学视频](https://www.ixigua.com/i6798808980865942030/) 

| button pressed  | action    |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| top_left  | turn left  |
| top_right  | turn right |
| top_left + top_right  | run forward  |
| bottom_left + bottom_rigth  | run backward  |

## 4. EV3/touch_sensor
>The car will run forward until the touch sensor was pressed. It will speak out "ouch" and then it will backward left to change the direction, after that, it will run forward again. Its' path is same as "avoid_block"  [头条教学视频](https://www.ixigua.com/i6798808980865942030/)

## 5. EV3/color_and_sound
>The color sensor detects different colors and speak out the color.  [头条教学视频](https://www.ixigua.com/i6799179127665459720/)

## 6. EV3/button_and_sound
>Press the buttons on the EV3 brick and the LED lights will change and the screen will display a laugh face.[头条教学视频](https://www.ixigua.com/i6799187901784523278/)

## 7. EV3/line_follower
>Implement the line follower movement with color sensor. There're two ways to implement that, one is simple algorithm, and another is proportional control algorithm. [头条教学视频](https://www.ixigua.com/i6801746408090108423/)

> The suffix of DJI RoboMaster S1 Scratch project is 'dsp'
## 1. RoboMaster-S1/lesson1_chassis_mode.dsp and RoboMaster-S1/lesson1_gimbal_mode.dsp
>Introduce the Chassis mode and Gimbal mode.
